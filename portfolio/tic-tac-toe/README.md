# Tic Tac Toe project
Play a game of tic-tac-toe versus computer AI. For now, this is a mix of hard-coded winning and blocking moves with some added randomization when there are no "must play" squares.

Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

Features:
* Ability to select X or O
* Computer plays instantly and will block/win when applicable
* Notification of game result
* Lets you immediately play again without needing to select X or O again

Future ideas:
* Implement minimax algorithm for unbeatable AI.
* Add 2-player functionality
* Add running win/loss tally
* Add slight delay in AI movement to simulate a "real" opponent
